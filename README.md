# Launching An Object
This repository is all about objects and their trajectories when launched at a specific initial velocity.

In order to use this repo, you write at what point you want your object of choice to pass through, and then you let it do the work itself

You can use this repository to find the miniumum velocity needed in order for an object to hit a point as well as what angle is needs to be shot at. (Everything in the repository is written for the metric system, and uses meters for distance, meters/second for velocity, etc.)
