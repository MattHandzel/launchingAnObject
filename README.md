# Launching An Object
This repository is all about objects and their trajectories when launched at a specific initial velocity.

You can use this repository to find the miniumum velocity needed in order for an object to hit a point as well as what angle is needs to be shot at. (Everything in the repository is written for the metric system, and uses meters for distance, meters/second for velocity, etc.)

This repository was originally written for my robotics team so that we could do the calcluations of how hard and what direction to shoot an object, but we decided against it.
